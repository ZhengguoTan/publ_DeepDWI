Dear Author(s):

Thank you for submitting your revision, which was well-received. It is our pleasure to provisionally accept your manuscript entitled "High-Resolution Diffusion-Weighted Imaging with Self-Gated Self-Supervised Unrolled Reconstruction" for publication in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine pending minor revisions.

As you can see from the comments below, there are still some changes requested. Please address these with a final revision, which will be examined by the Deputy Editor. We consider the requested changes to be relatively minor, and we don’t expect the manuscript will require re-review by the Referees.

Comments to the Author
Thank you for addressing my previous concerns. I have one remaining question that I hope the authors can clarify:

1. Did the authors apply any correction procedures to the acquired data? In the axial visualizations shown in Figures 5 and 6, the top of the head appears to exhibit some distortion.
