	\section{Introduction}
	\label{SEC:INTRO}
	\IEEEPARstart{H}{igh}-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (HD-MRI),
	referring to the acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis of
	multi-dimensional imaging,
    in contrast to single-contrast-weighted, static, and two-dimensional imaging.
	Examples of HD-MRI include but are not limited to
    magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) \cite{brown_1982_mrsi},
    diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) \cite{lebihan_1986_diff},
    and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) \cite{ma_2013_mrf}.
    MRSI uses multiple readout gradients to acquire multiple echo images
    for the computation of spatially resolved metabolic distribution.
    DWI utilizes spatially and angularly varying
    diffusion encoding gradients
    to obtain multi-contrast diffusion-weighted images
    as a probe into tissue microstructure.
    MRF designs a $T_1$- and $T_2$-prepared pseudo-randomized sequence
    to acquire time-resolved transient-state images,
    which are matched with Bloch-equation generated dictionaries \cite{doneva_2010_moba}
	for simultaneous quantitative $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping.

	HD-MRI, however, conventionally requires long scan time
	and high computational burden.
	Advances in parallel imaging
	\cite{roemer_1990_pi,sodickson_1997_smash,
	pruessmann_1999_sense,pruessmann_2001_gsense,griswold_2002_grappa}
	and compressed sensing
	\cite{lustig_2007_cs,block_2007_cs,liang_2007_psf}
	have enabled accelerated acquisition for HD-MRI. For instance,
	Lam et al.~\cite{lam_2014_spice} proposed SPectroscopic Imaging
	by exploiting spatiospectral CorrElation (SPICE)
	based on the low-rank modeling.
	% Block et al.~\cite{block_2014_rad} and Feng et al.~\cite{feng_2014_grasp}
	% proposed iterative golden-angle radial sparse parallel imaging (GRASP)
	% with total variation regularization \cite{rudin_1992_tv} in the time domain,
	% enabling robust free-breathing time-resolved abdominal imaging and
	% breast dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging with reduced motion artifacts.
	McGivney et al.~\cite{mcgivney_2014_svdmrf}
	proposed the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) and thresholding
	to compress the MRF dictionary and to reduce the computational burden.
	Further, Christodoulou et al.~\cite{christodoulou_2018_mt}
	proposed MR Multitasking with higher-order SVD (HOSVD) modeling
	and iterative reconstruction
	for motion-resolved quantitative $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping.
    However, the use of patch-based SVD still requires long computational time.

	Beyond sparsity constraint and low-rank modeling,
	advanced neural networks, e.g.~denoising autoencoder \cite{hinton_2006_ae},
	have been explored for HD-MRI reconstruction.
	Lam et al.~\cite{lam_2019_mrsi} proposed
	to first learn a DAE model
	from physics-informed simulated data
	and then incorporate the learned DAE model as a regularizer
	in iterative reconstruction.
	This concept was adopted by Mani et al.~\cite{mani_2021_qmodel}
	for joint $k$-$q$-space DWI reconstruction using learned DAE \textit{priors}.
	Further, Arefeen et al.~\cite{arefeen_2023_latent} proposed
	to replace the conventional SVD-based linear subspace modeling
    \cite{huang_2012_t2basis}
	by the latent decoder model within DAE
	for improved multi-$T_2$-weighted image reconstruction.
	Besides learning a \textit{prior} based on simulated data
	for regularization or latent space modeling,
	Hammernik et al.~\cite{hammernik_2018_varnet} and
	Aggarwal et al.~\cite{aggarwal_2018_modl}
	proposed supervised learning unroll reconstruction networks,
	which are trained by fully-sampled in vivo data.
	Yaman et al.~\cite{yaman_2020_ssdu,yaman_2022_zs}
	proposed the self-supervised learning unroll network
    without fully-sampled data,
	which builds upon the concept of cross-validation in machine learning.
