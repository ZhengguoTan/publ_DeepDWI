\section{Introduction}\label{SEC:INTRO}

High-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
has been a flourishing field,
focused on the acquisition, reconstruction and analysis of
multi-dimensional multi-contrast-weighted MRI data.
Examples of high-dimensional MRI include but are not limited to
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)
\cite{brown_1982_mrsi},
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
\cite{jones_2010_diff},
and quantitative parameter mapping
\cite{doneva_2010_moba,ma_2013_mrf}.
High-dimensional MRI, however, requires long acquisition times,
making the data susceptible to subject motion
and system imperfections, and imposing high computational burden.
DWI, in particular, poses challenges in the pursuit of
high spatial, temporal, and angular resolution.
DWI is typically acquired using
the pulsed gradient spin echo diffusion-weighted sequence
\cite{stejskal_1965_pgse}
followed by fast echo-planar imaging (EPI) readouts
\cite{mansfield_1977_epi}.
However, the use of long echo trains in EPI results in
geometric distortion artifacts and reduced spatial resolution.
Additionally, acquiring multiple diffusion directions
to enhance angular resolution and
to better probe tissue microstructure further extends the scan time.

Advances in parallel imaging
\cite{roemer_1990_pi,sodickson_1997_smash,
pruessmann_1999_sense,pruessmann_2001_gsense,griswold_2002_grappa}
and compressed sensing
\cite{lustig_2007_cs,block_2007_cs,liang_2007_psf}
have enabled accelerated acquisition of high-dimensional data.
Notably, the low-rank model \cite{cai_2010_svt}
has been a powerful tool in dimension reduction.
Typically, singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to
learn a truncated temporal basis function from
a large-scale physics-informed dictionary
\cite{huang_2012_t2basis,lam_2014_spice,mcgivney_2014_svdmrf}.
The temporal basis function is then integrated
with the MRI forward model,
i.e.~the sensitivity encoding operator \cite{pruessmann_2001_gsense},
for joint reconstruction of the corresponding spatial basis images.
In addition, low-rank regularization can be employed
in the joint reconstruction \cite{tamir_2017_t2shuffling}.

Beyond the low-rank technique,
advanced neural networks, e.g., autoencoder \cite{hinton_2006_ae},
have been explored for high-dimensional MRI reconstruction and
proven to supply more accurate representations of
high-dimensional data than SVD.
Lam et al.~\cite{lam_2019_mrsi} and Mani et al.~\cite{mani_2021_qmodel}
proposed to first learn a denoising autoencoder (DAE) model
from a physics-informed simulated dictionary
and then incorporate the learned DAE model as a regularizer
in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
\cite{boyd_2010_admm}
unrolling reconstruction.
Pioneered by Gregor and LeCun \cite{gregor_2010_algunroll},
algorithm unrolling enables the use of learned deep \textit{priors}
as regularization and offers faster inference compared to
iterative reconstruction methods that rely on hand-crafted regularization functions
\cite{monga_2021_algunroll}.
Algorithm unrolling has been applied to
accelerated MRI reconstruction in various scenarios:
including but not limited to
supervised learning with fully sampled reference images
\cite{yang_2018_admmnet,hammernik_2018_varnet,aggarwal_2018_modl},
and self-supervised learning
with only undersampled data available for training
\cite{yaman_2020_ssdu,yaman_2022_zs}.

Deep neural networks are capable of learning
not only regularization functions,
but also MR-physics forward operators.
%Liu et al.~\cite{liu_2021_relax} proposed
%the reference-free $T_1$ parameter maps extraction (RELAX)
%self-supervised deep learning reconstruction,
%which learns the mapping from $T_1$ parameter maps to
%undersampled multi-coil multi-contrast $k$-space data.
Arefeen et al.~\cite{arefeen_2023_latent} proposed
to replace the conventional SVD-based linear subspace modeling
\cite{huang_2012_t2basis}
by the latent decoder model within DAE
for improved $T_2$-weighted image reconstruction.
The ability of DAE to learn DWI models is somewhat uncertain.
DAE is composed of sequential fully connected layers
with nonlinear activation functions,
which may struggle with complex functions like those required for DWI signals.
On the other hand,
the diffusion tensor and kurtosis model \cite{basser_1994_dmri}
consists of at least six tensor elements,
so the diffusion-weighted signal dictionary
based on these models
usually requires tens of millions atoms.
On the other hand, acquiring fully sampled DWI
for training a regularization function is quite challenging.
First, fully-sampled DWI requires much longer echo trains in EPI,
which not only elongates the scan times
but also reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Second, the variety of diffusion acquisition modes necessitates
a larger dataset compared to two-dimensional imaging scenarios
\cite{knoll_2020_fastmri}.
As a result, self-supervised learning is better suited
for DWI reconstruction.

In this work, we have developed a ADMM unrolling technique
to perform scan-specific self-supervised learning
and incorporate self-gated shot-to-shot phase variation estimation
into the data-consistency term for deep diffusion-weighted imaging reconstruction.
We demonstrate that the trained ADMM unrolling model from one single slice
can be applied to all other slices.
This significantly reduces the training time.
We achieve navigator-free high-resolution DWI with 21 diffusion-encoding
directions at \SI{0.7}{\milli\meter} isotropic resolution,
a scan time of under 10 minutes, and a reconstruction time of about 1 minute per slice.

\subsection{Multi-Band Multi-Shot DWI with Diffusion-Shift Encoding}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{./figures/fig1.png}
	\caption{Multi-shot DWI with diffusion shift encoding. 
		This work employs 3-shot per diffusion encoding and each shot has an in-plane undersampling factor of 6.
		Therefore, every three columns have the same color. The starting $k_y$ line is shifted between 
		adjacent diffusion encoding to create complementary $k$-$q$-space sampling.}
	\label{FIG:SHIFT}
\end{figure}

Our previous work \cite{tan_2024_naviepi} demonstrated
the joint $k$-$q$-slice reconstruction 
for multi-band multi-shot navigator-based interleaved EPI (NAViEPI) DWI acquisition 
with difusion-shift encoding.
As show in \cref{FIG:SHIFT}, the starting $k_y$ line for a diffusion encoding is shifted 
with respect to its adjacent one to create complementary $k$-$q$-slice sampling pattern.
In the joint reconstruction, the forward model 
maps the multi-slice multi-diffusion-weighted images ($\mathbf{x}$)
to their corresponding $k$-space,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{P \Sigma \Theta F S \Phi} \mathbf{x}
    \label{EQU:FWD}
\end{equation}
Here, the images $\mathbf{x}$ are point-wise multiplied
with the pre-computed shot-to-shot phase variation maps ($\mathbf{\Phi}$)
and coil sensitivity maps ($\mathbf{S}$).
The output images are then converted to $k$-space
via two-dimensional fast Fourier transform ($\mathbf{F}$),
point-wise multiplied with the multi-band phases ($\mathbf{\Theta}$),
summed along the slice dimension ($\mathbf{\Sigma}$),
and then multiplied by the $k$-space undersampling mask ($\mathbf{P}$).

In \cref{EQU:FWD}, one challenge is
to accurately estimate the shot-to-shot phase variation.
Multiplexed sensitivity-encoding (MUSE) type reconstruction techniques
\cite{liu_2004_diff_spiral,uecker_2009_nlinv_diff,chen_2013_muse,merrem_2019_nl_steam}
achieved the self-gating strategy,
where the $k$-space data of each shot were used to reconstruct
its corresponding shot image followed by a phase smoothing approach.
Self-gated shot phase estimation does not require
the acquisition of phase navigator data.
However, it requires small undersampling factors per shot and
fully-sampled DWI acquisition assembling all shots.
Alternatively, undersampled DWI acquisition can be enabled
via the acquisition of navigators for shot phase estimation
\cite{tan_2024_naviepi}.
This approach allows for mesoscale-resolution DWI at \SI{7}{\tesla},
but still needs long scan time.
As listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ}, the total acquisition of
Protocol \#1 at \SI{0.7}{mm} isotropic resolution
takes $16:27$ minutes with phase navigators.
This scan time can be reduced to approximately 10 minutes
be removing the phase navigators (Protocol \#2 in \cref{TAB:ACQ}).

With the operator $\mathcal{A}$, the joint reconstruction reads,
\begin{equation}
    \argmin_{\mathbf{x}} \norm{\mathbf{y} - \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})}_2^2 + \lambda \mathcal{R}(\mathbf{x})
    \label{EQU:INV}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{y}$ is the measured $k$-space data.
The first term in \cref{EQU:INV} presents the data-consistency term, and
the second term presents the regularization function $\mathcal{R}(x)$
with the regularization strength $\lambda$.
When using the Tikhonov regularization,
i.e.~$\mathcal{R}(\mathbf{x}) = \norm{\mathbf{x}}_2^2$,
\cref{EQU:INV} can be solved via the conjugate gradient (CG) method.
For nonlinear regularization functions,
such as the locally-low rank (LLR) regularzation \cite{tan_2024_naviepi} or
neural networks with nonlinear activation functions.
ADMM was employed in this work to solve for \cref{EQU:INV}.

    \caption{Illustration of the key components in ADMM unrolling.
        \textbf{(A)} The sampling mask $P$ in \cref{EQU:FWD} was
        uniformly split into three disjoint sets:
        the training mask $\mathbf{T}$ used for
        the data consistency term during training,
        the train loss mask $\mathbf{L}$ used for
        the loss function calculation during training, and
        the validation loss mask $\mathbf{V}$ used for
        the loss function calculation during validation.
        \textbf{(B)} and \textbf{(C)} show the flowchart
        for the training and the validation of an unrolled ADMM model, respectively.
        Note that the ResNet parameters $\omega$ are updated
        via ADAM \cite{kingma_2015_adam} during training,
        but remain fixed during the validation step.
        \textbf{(D)} A stack of diffusion-weighted images
        is input into ResNet during ADMM unrolling.}
    \label{FIG:ZSSSL}
\end{figure}

Instead of the two-step alternating minimization unrolling scheme as used in MoDL
\cite{aggarwal_2018_modl},
we employed the ADMM unrolling
to solve the self-supervised learning reconstruction
in \cref{EQU:INV}. The update rule of ADMM unrolling reads
\begin{equation} \label{EQU:ADMM}
    \left\{\begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} &= \argmin_{\mathbf{x}^{(k)}} \norm{\mathbf{y} - \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}^{(k)})}_2^2 + \frac{\rho}{2} \norm{ \mathbf{x}^{(k)} - \mathbf{v}^{(k)} + \mathbf{u}^{(k)}}_2^2 \\
        \mathbf{v}^{(k+1)} &= (\lambda/\rho) \cdot \mathcal{D}_{\omega} (\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} + \mathbf{u}^{(k)}) \\
        \mathbf{u}^{(k+1)} &= \mathbf{u}^{(k)} + \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} - \mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}
    \end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation}
ADMM updates the variables $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{v}$,
and $\mathbf{u}$ in an alternating scheme.
It splits the unrolled reconstruction into three steps,
as shown in \cref{EQU:ADMM} and in the pseudo code of \cref{ALG:ADMM}.
First, the updating step for $\mathbf{x}$ is solved by conjugate gradient.
Second, the variable $\mathbf{v}$ is then updated
via the forward pass of the neural network $\mathcal{D}_{\omega}$
with the input as the sum of current estimates
of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{u}$.
Third, the variable $\mathbf{u}$ is updated
by adding its current estimate to the difference
between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{v}$.

As shown in \cref{FIG:ZSSSL}, to train an unrolled ADMM model,
the data sampling mask $\mathbf{P}$
is split into three disjoint sets,
the training mask $\mathbf{T}$ for the data consistency term,
the training loss mask $\mathbf{L}$ for the loss function calculation,
and the validation loss mask $\mathbf{V}$.
Each set consists of 12 repetitions constructed via random uniform sampling
of the data mask $\mathbf{P}$.
In each training epoch, every repetition is looped through
in order to update the ResNet parameters $\omega$.
Plus, the validation step is performed after every training epoch
to update the minimal validation loss.
If the validation loss does not reduce for 12 consecutive epochs or
if 100 epochs are reached, the training is terminated.

The index $k$ in \cref{EQU:ADMM} denotes the unrolling iteration,
and $\mathcal{D}_{\omega}$ denotes the ResNet \cite{he_2016_resnet}
parameterized by $\omega$.
In this work, 2D convolution was employed to construct the ResNet layers.
In PyTorch, 2D convolution requires four-dimensional tensors as input and output.
For instance, a matrix with the size $(N, C, H, W)$ is acceptable
for the the 'conv2d' function in PyTorch.
Here, $W$ and $H$ denote the width and height of the convolution kernel,
$C$ denotes the number of channels, and $N$ denotes the batch size.
However, the diffusion-weighted images ($\mathbf{x}$) to be reconstructed
has the size $(N_{\text{diff}}, N_Z, N_Y, N_X, 2)$,
where $2$ stands for the real and imaginary part
of the complex-valued diffusion-weighted images,
$N_X$ and $N_Y$ are the width and the height of diffusion-weighted images,
$N_Z$ is the number of slices (identical to the multi-band factor), and
$N_{\text{diff}}$ is the number of diffusion encoding.
To train a ResNet based on 2D convolution,
the diffusion-weighted images were reshaped and permuted
as $(N_Z, 2 \cdot N_{\text{diff}}, N_Y, N_X)$, as illustrated in \cref{FIG:ZSSSL} (D).
In this manner, 2D convolution kernels in combination with ReLU activation functions
loop through the varying diffusion-weighted contrast
to learn the key features of the high-dimensional data and
to reduce noisy and aliasing artifacts in unrolled reconstruction.

\subsection{Model Generalizability} \label{SEC:ZSSSL_GEN}

Volumetric whole brain DWI acquisition consists of many multi-band slices,
and the training of algorithm unrolling models on all slices requires
hundreds of GPU computing hours.
To investigate the model generalizability and to accelerate reconstruction,
we performed two training and inference strategies.
First, we trained the ADMM unrolling model with only one multi-band slice data,
and then tested the model on all remaining multi-band slices.
We dubbed this approach as "single-slice training".
Second, we trained and tested every multi-band slice individually,
which was dubbed as "slice-by-slice training".
The single-slice training strategy saves tremendous computing time,
as its model is learned from one single slice and
the inference time per slice is only about one minute.
By comparing these two training strategies,
we aim at demonstrating the model generalizability and
its applicability to other slices which are "unseen" in single-slice training.

\subsection{Comparison of Regularization Techniques}

This work compared the reconstruction performance
of three different regularization techniques,
Tikhonov $\ell^2$ regularization (as used in MUSE),
LLR regularization,
and ADMM unrolling with a learned regularization.
Note that MUSE is a simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) parallel imaging method
and poses no regularization along the diffusion dimension,
effectively solving each DWI reconstruction independently.
In contrast, all the other two regularized reconstructions
fall into the joint reconstruction regime.
They jointly reconstruct all diffusion-weighted images
and impose regularization terms exploring spatial-diffusion redundancies.
For example, LLR enforces the low rankness of
local spatial-diffusion matrices from diffusion-weighted images,
whereas ADMM unrolling learns a regularization function composed by neural networks
based on spatial-diffusion convolution kernels
while enforcing data consistency during the unrolled training process.

\cref{TAB:ACQ} lists two acquisition protocols implemented on
a clinical \SI{7}{\tesla} MR system
(MAGNETOM Terra, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany)
equipped with a 32-channel head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA)
and the XR-gradient system
(maximum gradient strength \SI{80}{\milli\tesla/\meter} and
a peak slew rate \SI{200}{\tesla/\meter/\second}).
Protocols \#1 and \#2 realized mesoscale high-resolution DWI with \SI{0.7}{mm}
isotropic resolution. Two-fold acceleration is employed
in both in-plane and slice directions.
Every Diffusion encoding is acquired by three shots in an interleaved manner 
and is shifted with respect to its former one,
which resultes in $6 \times 2$-fold acceleration per shot.
Noteworthy, the total scan time can be reduced to about 10~minutes
(Protocol \#2) when switching off navigator acquisition.

Three young healthy volunteers with written informed consent
approved by the local ethics committee
participated in this study.
All reconstructions in this work were done on a single A100 SXM4/NVLink GPU
with \SI{80}{\giga\byte} memory (NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

%\subsection{Self-Gated ADMM Unrolling}
%
%As discussed in \cref{SEC:FWD}, there are two approaches for
%estimating shot-to-shot phase variation: self-gated and navigator-based.
%The self-gated approach, as used in MUSE \cite{chen_2013_muse},
%requires fully-sampled DWI acquisition and
%has typically reported only a small number of shots (up to 4).
%The previously proposed NAViEPI approach enabled high-resolution DWI
%with the use of undersampled iEPI and shot-to-shot phase navigator acquisition.
%While NAViEPI results in shorter scan time than fully-sampled iEPI,
%the use of phase navigator still elongates the acquisition,
%as listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ}.
%Therefore, a key question is whether it is feasible to
%discard the shot-to-shot phase navigator
%while keeping undersampled iEPI acquisition.
%In this work, we investigated the feasibility of ADMM unrolling in self-gated scan
%for \SI{0.7}{\milli\meter} isotropic resolution DWI.

            at the 10th diffusion direction
            between (1) and (2).
            The bottom panel plots the mean and standard deviation
            of the signal within yellow and green rectangles
            in the slide-by-slice training and the single-slice training,
            respectively.
            No major qualitative or quantitative difference can be seen
            between the two training strategies.}
    \label{FIG:GENERALIZATION}
\end{figure*}

\cref{FIG:GENERALIZATION} demonstrates the generalizability
of the proposed ADMM unrolling approach,
i.e., an unrolled ADMM model trained on one single slice
is applicable to all remaining "unseen" slices.
Single-direction diffusion-weighted images from
both the slice-by-slice training
and the single-slice training strategies are displayed.
The absolute difference between these two images
shows no residual structural information, but mainly noise.
Further, we plotted the mean and standard deviation
within the selected region-of-interest (colored boxes in \cref{FIG:GENERALIZATION})
along all diffusion encoding.
This again proves the cross-slice generalization
of the proposed ADMM unrolling method.
The plotted curves show quantitatively similar values
between the two training strategies.
With this, all following results were obtained
utilizing the single-slice training strategy.

\subsection{Retrospectively Self-Gated ADMM Unrolling}

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/fig4.png}
    \caption{Comparison of (top) LLR regularized
            and (bottom) ADMM unrolling
            reconstruction on 0.7~mm isotropic resolution DWI
            acquired by Protocol \#1
            with shot phase estimated from
            (left) navigators and (middle) imaging echoes, respectively.
            Zoomed views of the yellow boxes from the self-gated reconstruction
            are displayed in the right-most column.
            The use of navigators prolongs the total scan time,
            and thus increases the sensitivity to motion,
            as shown in the single-direction diffusion-weighted image
            reconstructed with navigated shot phase,
            where accidental motion occurred during navigator acquisition.
            The retrospectively self-gated reconstruction discards navigators,
            and renders sharper diffusion-weighted images.
            Compared to LLR, unrolled ADMM is advantageous
            in resolving clearer tissue boundaries
            in diffusion-weighted images,
            as indicated by red arrows.}
            \label{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_TRA}
\end{figure*}

\cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_TRA} demonstrates
the efficacy of the self-gated self-supervised ADMM unrolling reconstruction
by comparing to the navigated and self-gated reconstructions
on the first volunteer.
Data were acquired by the NAViEPI sequence,
as listed in Protocol \#1 in \cref{TAB:ACQ}.
The single-direction diffusion-weighted images with accidental motion
are displayed.

The selected diffusion encoding shows residual aliasing-like and
severe motion-blurring artifacts
in the navigated reconstructions,
including both LLR regularization and ADMM unrolling.
The main reason of these artifacts is that
the acquisition of navigators
increases the total scan time,
resulting in higher sensitivity to accidental inter-shot motion.
Admittedly, navigators are valuable
in the case of ultra high spatial resolution
using many shots, e.g.~3-fold in-plane undersampling and 5-shot acquisition
for the in-plane resolution of 0.5~mm \cite{tan_2024_naviepi},
which led to an in-plane acceleration of $15$ per shot.
In contrast, this experiment utilized 3 shots, yielding
$6 \times 2$-fold acceleration per shot (refer to Protocol \#1).
Such an acceleration rate proves achievable in the self-gated approach.
Both LLR regularized and unrolled ADMM reconstructions supply geometrically correct
diffusion-weighted images
without noticeable aliasing artifacts.
This in turn indicates that motion corrupted the navigator data
in this measurement.
Further, self-gated ADMM unrolling exhibits much clearer tissue delineation
in reconstructed diffusion-weighted images,
as indicated by red arrows in the zoomed-in views
in \cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_TRA},
whereas self-gated LLR suffers from
slightly blurry tissue boundaries and ambiguous signals.

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/fig5.png}
    \caption{Single-direction diffusion-weighted images
            at 0.7~mm isotropic resolution

            (left) LLR and (right) ADMM unrolling
            in (top) the coronal and (bottom) the sagittal views, respectively.
            The same diffusion direction as in \cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_TRA}
            is chosen for display.
            ADMM unrolling reduces phase ambiguities
            in the shot-combined reconstruction,
            thereby rendering clearer tissue delineation and
            reducing stripping artifacts (as indicated by the red arrows).}
        \label{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_2}
\end{figure*}

\cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_2} shows coronal- and saggital-view
diffusion-weighted images
with the same diffusion encoding as in \cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_TRA}.
As mentioned in \cref{SEC:ZSSSL_GEN}, the unrolled ADMM model
was trained using only one slice
and then inferred on all remaining slices.
The model generalizes well across slices.
The inference of every slice takes only about one minute,
whereas the LLR reconstruction takes about 48~minutes per slice.
More importantly, the self-gated LLR reconstruction exhibits residual
motion-induced stripping artifacts
(refer to red arrows in \cref{FIG:MOTION_RETRO_2}) \cite{chang_2021_musium},
whereas the self-gated ADMM unrolling approach substantially removes these artifacts
and supplies high-quality diffusion-weighted images without the need of navigators.
Both reconstructions show $B_1$ field inhomogeneities in the cerebellum region
and residual spatial distortion in the frontal brain region.
These artifacts, however, are beyond the scope of this work.


\subsection{Prospectively Self-Gated ADMM Unrolling}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/fig6.png}
    \caption{0.7~mm isotropic mesoscale DWI with 21 volumes at about 10~minutes
        without the acquisition of navigators.
        (A) Single-direction diffusion-weighted images and
        (B) Mean diffusion-weighted images of 20 diffusion directions
        at three orthogonal orientations are displayed.
        Diffusion-weighted images were reconstructed by
        (top) MUSE, (middle) LLR, and (bottom) ADMM unrolling.
        MUSE suffers from severe noise artifacts at such small voxel size.
        LLR is able to clean up most of the noise,
        but is still hampered by signal void artifacts in the axial view,
        which appears as stripping artifacts in coronal and sagittal views
        (as indicated by red arrows).
        ADMM unrolling significantly reduces both noise and signal voids.
        In the mean diffusion-weighted images, LLR shows amplified noise
        in the cerebellum region (see the blue arrow in the sagittal view),
        whereas ADMM unrolling yields more homogeneous signal distributions.}
    \label{FIG:MOTION_PROS}
\end{figure*}

\cref{FIG:MOTION_PROS} compares the reconstruction results
using the prospectively acquired iEPI data without navigators
of the second volunteer
(refer to Protocol \#2 in \cref{TAB:ACQ}).
The snapshot single diffusion-direction diffusion-weighted images
as well as mean diffusion-weighted images
at three orthogonal views were displayed.

The MUSE reconstruction suffers from strong noise
at such mesoscale voxel size.
Its corresponding mean diffusion-weighted images show
improved the visibility of brain tissues,
but the overall image quality is not sufficient.
The LLR regularized reconstruction largely reduces noise,
but still exhibits suspicious dark signal in the axial view,
which appears as striping artifacts in the coronal and the sagittal views
(refer to the red arrows in \cref{FIG:MOTION_PROS}).
On the other hand, the LLR regularized reconstruction
shows amplified noise in the cerebellum region
(refer to the blue arrow in the sagittal view of \cref{FIG:MOTION_PROS}),
which could be caused by the $B_1$ excitation field inhomogeneity
at \SI{7}{\tesla}.

The above-mentioned striping artifacts are nearly gone
in the unrolled ADMM reconstruction.
Moreover, the diffusion-weighted images from ADMM unrolling in the axial view
show clearer diffusion contrasts
and thus better tissue delineation and continuity
in the coronal and the sagittal views.
Further, as indicated by the blue arrows in \cref{FIG:MOTION_PROS},
the diffusion-weighted image in the sagittal view shows more homogeneous
signal distribution and reduced noise surrounding the cerebellum.

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figures/fig7.png}
    \caption{Convergence analysis along the ADMM unrolling training
        and validation epochs

        Displayed curves are (red solid) the training loss,
        (red dashed) the validation loss,
        and (blue solid) the learned regularization strength $\lambda$, respectively.
        All parameters converge sufficiently and show no over-fitting.}
    \label{FIG:CONVERGENCE}
\end{figure}

\cref{FIG:CONVERGENCE} displays the training and validation loss
as well as the learned regularization strength along epochs
for the results shown in \cref{FIG:MOTION_PROS}.
It can be seen that 100 epochs are sufficient for
the convergence of ADMM unrolling.
The model converges well along epochs,
and does not show any over-fitting behavior
(The validation loss decays similarly as the training loss).
In addition, the regularization strength converges
to the value of about 0.027.

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/fig8.png}
    \caption{Prospectively self-gated DWI reconstruction results
        at 0.7~mm isotropic resolution. Displayed images are
        one axial slice at four different diffusion-encoding directions.
        ADMM unrolling enables much cleaner delineations of diffusion contrasts
        than LLR regularized reconstruction.}
    \label{FIG:SG_ZSSSL_VOL3}
\end{figure*}

\cref{FIG:SG_ZSSSL_VOL3} shows the reconstructed diffusion-weighted images
at four different diffusion directions based on the iEPI data
acquired from the third volunteer
(the same subject as in \cref{FIG:GENERALIZATION}).
In this experiment, the volunteer was instructed
to keep still during scan.
Again, the proposed self-gated ADMM unrolling reconstruction
with spatial-diffusion convolution illustrates
superior tissue structure delineation and
diffusion contrasts
to the LLR regularized reconstruction.
The LLR reconstruction suffers from
amplified noise in the frontal brain region.
In contrast, the unrolled ADMM approach generally illustrates
more homogeneous signal and noise distribution
across the field-of-view.
While LLR builds upon one single linear transformation
(singular-value decomposition, SVD) and
one nonlinear operation (soft thresholding) \cite{cai_2010_svt},
the ResNet in ADMM unrolling builds upon
multiple two-dimensional convolutions and nonlinear activation functions.
Therefore, deep neural networks enable more in-depth exploration
of key features in the high-dimensional data.

\section{Discussion}\label{SEC:DISC}

This work reported a novel self-gated self-supervised learning approach
based on ADMM unrolling
for multi-shot undersampled iEPI acquisition and high-resolution DWI reconstruction.
The self-gated ADMM unrolling achieved whole brain DWI
with 20 diffusion-encoded directions and a $b$-value of \SI{1000}{s/mm^2}
at \SI{0.7}{mm} isotropic resolution,
all within a scan time of less than 10 minutes.
For comparison, the compressed sensing reconstruction with
locally-low rank regularization was implemented also with the generic ADMM algorithm.
Thus, our work assured fair comparison among different regularization methods.

The proposed self-gated ADMM unrolling approach is well-suited
for online reconstruction deployment.
Firstly, it requires much shorter acquisition time than
the conventional MUSE approach with fully-sampled iEPI and
our previous NAViEPI method.
Secondly, it does not require large-scale fully-sampled data for training.
Instead, its training is scan specific and requires only one slice.
The trained ADMM unrolling model is applicable to different slices.
Third, the inference time of the trained model is much
shorter compared to the LLR regularization approach.

We observed that stripping-type motion artifacts occurred more frequently
in the sub-millimeter isotropic resolution DWI regime.
In addition, sub-millimeter isotropic voxel
resulted in higher noise in diffusion-weighted images.
This makes sense, as scans with reduced slice thickness are more susceptible to
shot-to-shot phase variations.
To enable sub-millimeter mesoscale DWI,
Setsompop et al.~\cite{setsompop_2018_gslider}
proposed the gSlider technique with slice phase–dither encoding,
which excites one slab multiple times with complementary slice encoding schemes.
gSlider has been proven effective in alleviating motion sensitivity,
because the thicker slab (in comparison to the thin single slice)
reduced inter-slice motion.
Meanwhile, Hadamard encoding of the slices within a slab gained SNR
in the linear inverse reconstruction.
However, it has been reported that gSlider has stricter requirements
on $B_0$ and $B_1$ field homogeneities
and shows residual slab boundary artifacts
\cite{dai_2021_smslab}.
In contrast, the proposed self-gated self-supervised ADMM unrolling method
requires no such advanced slab encoding,
while achieves sub-millimeter resolution
at a clinical feasible reconstruction time.
Thus, the proposed method can be useful for the probe to high-resolution
brain micro-structures in the human connectome project \cite{huang_2021_hcp2}.
On the other hand, since unrolled algorithms are flexible to
MR physics modeling (e.g., the forward operator $\mathcal{A}$),
the proposed ADMM unrolling can be extended
to incorporate with the gSlider encoding model for enhanced SNR performance.

This work demonstrated the capability of self-gated ADMM unrolling in
reconstructing \SI{0.7}{mm} isotropic resolution 3-shot iEPI DWI
with $(6 \times 2)$-fold acceleration per shot.
However, we also observed that the self-gated approach
failed to recover aliasing-free diffusion-weighted images
in the case of higher acceleration factors
(e.g. the $0.5\times0.5\times2.0$~\si{mm^3} DWI data
with an acceleration of $15\times2$ per shot).
To address this issue, acquiring shot-to-shot phase navigators
helps with the shot-combined DWI reconstruction \cite{tan_2024_naviepi}.
Therefore, the utilization of navigator acquisition and
advanced deep learning reconstruction should be application oriented.
For ultra-high spatial resolution that requires many shots,
navigator is needed.
For the 0.7~mm resolution with 3 shots as shown in this work,
the self-gated acquisition is beneficial of reducing scan time,
given the superior performance of the proposed ADMM unrolling reconstruction.
Alternatively, employing optimized trajectories
with a more densely-sampled $k$-space central region
could help better estimate shot phase variations
\cite{liu_2004_diff_spiral,dai_2023_epti-diff}.

This work did not incorporate off-resonance correction in the reconstruction.
As a logic extension, the multi-shot sequence can be modified
to encode dynamic $B_0$ field variation, which can then be employed in the SENSE-based forward operator and reconstruction. An established approach
is known as the blip-up/down encoding \cite{zahneisen_2017_blipud}.
This approach requires the acquisition of two images
with opposing phase-encoding polarities (i.e., blip-up and blip-down)
for the computation of $B_0$ field maps.
An alternative approach is to iteratively update $B_0$ field
based on the phase difference among acquired multiple echoes \cite{tan_2023_meco}.
This approach does not require the pre-determination of $B_0$ field,
but poses higher computational demand in the inversion course of phase increments
from every echo.

\section{Conclusions}\label{SEC:CONCL}

In this work, we proposed a self-gated self-supervised learning
reconstruction framework based on ADMM unrolling
for high-resolution and motion-robust diffusion-weighted imaging
at ultra-high field.
Based on the mechanism of data splitting (cross validation),
our proposed ADMM unrolling requires only one single slice for training
and is generalized cross-slice.
Plus, ADMM unrolling renders ultra-short inference / reconstruction time,
and is thus feasible for clinical translation.
